#### An Android version of my resume

## About My Resume
MyResume is an android version of my resume. It features my job title, projects, experiences, and social media links. The app includes several about me sections and an email button to email me directly. 

## About the CodeBase
It is coded entirely in Kotlin. The designs were done in XML. Most of the codebase involves the layout and the design. But, I have included some logic to increase responsiveness. Some of the responsive features include multiple screens, a back button, a customized action bar, clickable links to social media accounts, and landscape mode which is detected automatically by the app. The layout for the landscape mode is specially designed for that. 

## About the Design
MyResume has a simple design. It has 3 pages and a splash screen intro screen. From the welcome screen to the last screen with all the details, the app is designed to take the user on a journey. Inspiration came from many ideas on dribble plus another one seen in a YouTube video. I can't possible mention all of the desingers whose amazing work contributed to this, but I appreciate them all. 

## About Libraries
I did not use any libraries. It's a very generic app. As a beginner at mobile development, I don't know very much about libraries in mobile dev. But, I'm looking forward to learning more. 

## If I had more time...
If I had more time, I would have worked on making the app more seamless and even more interactive. I would have included complex layouts and mindblowing designs.

## Challenges
First challenge, how to use android studio ðŸ˜³. But it worked. I already have some experience in programming, so learning Kotlin was not too challenging.
